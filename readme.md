 <summary><h3>👨‍💻 Hello everyone. I would like to introduce myself, (Click here)</h3></summary>
   
My name is Yoann Croguennec, I am 37 years old, having obtained a diploma as a web and mobile web developer, level V, in the training centre "Callac Soft College". Afterwards, I continued to train myself in React JS and Native for 1 1/2 years, with websites (Udemy, ...) and Youtubers (SDZ, PrimFX, Waked XY, Les teachers du net, ...), which helped me develop my skills as a web developer. Then I went to the training centre "Le Réacteur" (75010), in order to reinforce my knowledge but also to understand some parts that I had difficulty to assimilate.
